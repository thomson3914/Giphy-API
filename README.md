GifTastic - API + JSON   06-Week  Homework

This app displays buttons related to a certain topic and allows you to add search terms to generate additional buttons that when clicked, accesses the GIPHY API and generates 6 static GIPHY images. Click on an image to pause or play the GIF.

- Requirements 
The app takes the entered search term topics from a user input box and pushes them into array from which it creates buttons in the HTML. Clicking on a button grabs 6 static, still gif images from the GIPHY API and places them on the page.
When the user clicks one of the still GIPHY images, the gif should animate.
If the user clicks the gif again, it should stop playing.
The gif is displayed with its rating (PG, G, etc.).
